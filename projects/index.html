        <p>
        	In Spring 2013 I took 6.115, Microcomputer Project Lab, a class on programming microcontrollers. For my final project I built a 3D printer. I assembled a 3-axis CNC, wrote a gcode interpreter in 8051 assembly, built electronics to drive steppers and control hot end temperature, and wrote software to generate tool paths from SVGs.
