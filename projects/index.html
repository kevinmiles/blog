        	In Fall 2013 I took "How To Make Almost Anything", a class on digital fabrication tools and made a site documenting each of the weekly projects.

        <p>
            In Spring 2013 I took 6.115, Microcomputer Project Lab, a class on programming microcontrollers. For my final project I built a 3D printer. I wrote a gcode interpreter in 8051 assembly, built electronics to drive stepper motors and control hot end temperature, and wrote software to generate tool paths from SVGs.
