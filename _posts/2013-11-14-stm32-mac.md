As part of Input Devices week in [MAS.863 How To Make Almost Anything](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/people/nitsky/index.html) I wanted to work with the STM32 microcontroller, and had a STM32F3 Discovery board provided by the class. I spent almost two days trying to figure out how to compile and run programs on the device using my Mac. Frustrated by other guides to getting STM32 development working I decided to make my own.

<!-- more -->

First, install [homebrew](http://brew.sh) if you don't have it already:

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"`

I wrote two simple homebrew formulae for the components needed to compile and run code on the STM32.
To access them you have to use `brew tap`:

`brew tap nitsky/stm32`

Now you can run the installers:

`brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc`

`brew install --HEAD stlink`

This installs a GCC compiler for ARM along with STLink, a great utility which manages a connection with the STLink JTAG programmer. It broadcasts a gdb server on port 4242 that you can use to control the STM32.

Now everything is ready to load and run a program.

In one terminal tab, run `st-util`

In another terminal tab, run `arm-none-eabi-gdb`

In GDB you need to connect to the STLink server:

`(gdb) tar ext :4242`

Now you can load firmware and run it.

`(gdb) load blink.elf`

`(gdb) run`

If you are new to the STM32 I have an [example project on GitHub](https://github.com/nitsky/stm32-example).
